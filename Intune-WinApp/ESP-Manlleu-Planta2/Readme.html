<h1><a name="Limitations_en">Other important points</a></h1>

<p><h2><a name="">[General Issue]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Banner pages cannot be printed using the source tray that is selected to print "Chapter Page". Please use another source tray to print banner pages.
<li>With specific application, depending on the combination of post-processings features and number of copies set on the printer driver, only 1 copy is printed out even if set with multiple copies.
Post-processing features are the following.
<ul>
<li>Staple
<li>Punch
<li>Fold
<li>Sort
<li>Perfect Binding
<li>Layout and Booklet etc.<br>
The example of specific application : Microsoft Office
</ul>
<li>If the PC name is set with a character string containing 16 bytes or more, Hostname on the banner is printed only up to 15 bytes.
<li>On some applications, the backside of a duplex page is incremented by the device counter. These applications add a blank page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the number of copies using the driver.
<li>Use of Raster Mode with the Layout settings (= pages per sheet) may be printed roughly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Vector Mode in the PCL driver.
<li>If the registry and configuration files that are generated during driver installation are edited or deleted, the behavior of the driver is not guaranteed.
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[OS/Windows Related Issues]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The driver's "Web Image Monitor" button might not work in an IPv6 environment. 
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[Driver Setting Related Issues]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The number of copies setting of the printer driver might not work as expected when printing the following applications:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Reader
<li>Adobe Acrobat
<li>Adobe Illustrator
<li>Adobe InDesign
</ul>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the number of copies in application.
<li>The use of Reverse Order is not supported with the Duplex, Front Cover, Back Cover, Chapter Pages, Slip Sheet functions.
<li>If the Staple setting is "2 at Center" or if the "Reverse Order" setting is On, the driver will add an extra page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page will be incremented in the printer's counter. There is no way to prevent this.
<li>A paper mismatch error occurs, if the paper size unit set in Custom Paper Size dialog is different to that set in "Custom Size" settings on the printer operation panel.
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[Printing Issues]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Additional Page Count in Duplex Printing
An extra page is added to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page might be incremented in the printer's counter.
<li>Thin lines printed at high resolution (1200dpix1200dpi) might be difficult to see in the printed output. In such cases, use of a lower resolution is recommended.
<li>Some shaded images may not be printed correctly when Raster Mode is used.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Vector Mode in the PCL driver.
<li>Depending on the combination of text and font settings for watermark, text might not be printed.<br>
In such case, a change of font is recommended.
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[B/W print with CMYK setting Issue]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If the "Color/ Black and White" setting  is "Color" some purely BW objects might be printed using CMYK toners (composite black). If the "Color/ Black and White" setting = "Black and White", all objects will be printed using K toner (pure black) only.
</ul>
